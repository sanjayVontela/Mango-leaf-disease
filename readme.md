This Python code is a multi-class image classification model trained on a dataset of images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The dataset consists of images of different categories, each stored in a separate folder. The code loads the data, preprocesses the images, encodes the labels, and splits the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. The model architecture consists of convolutional, max pooling, batch normalization, and dense layers. The code includes callbacks to save the best model and prevent overfitting. It evaluates the model's accuracy and generates a classification report and confusion matrix. The code also includes other model architectures, including VGG16 and KNN.
